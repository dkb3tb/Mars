            Unfortunately, you never entered the Hohmann transfer orbit to Mars properly. Precise calculations are
            needed in spacelfight. There is very little room for error, much like there is when you pilot a vehicle
            on Earth.

            The Hohmann transfer allows us to use the least amount of fuel possible. The rocket is already in solar
            orbit, and this needs to be adjusted. The desired orbit's perihelion will be at the distance of Earth's,
            while the aphelion will be at the distance of Mars'.

            In order to find the required delta-v of the transfer orbit, we needed to first find the semimajor axis of
            the transfer orbit. This is accomplished by taking the average of the semimajor axes of Earth and Mars,
            which is 1.762.

            The vis-viva equation helps us to calculate the delta-v required for the transfer maneuver. Delta-v
            is defined as the difference between the transfer perigee velocity and that of the LEO velocity. To find
            these intermediate velocities, we use radius from Earth, semimajor axis of orbit, and the standard
            gravitational parameter of the central body in the vis-viva equation.
