            Sorry Commander, you weren‚Äôt able to enter the Martian atmosphere. This is a difficult feat that
            astronauts going to Mars with have to face when they both enter Mars‚Äô orbit and enter its atmosphere.
            In order to land safely, the pilot will need to guide the spacecraft on a trajectory of
            exactly 12 degrees (though we gave you some leeway in this question üòâ).
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            Mars‚Äô atmosphere is thin like Earth‚Äôs, so it provides a good source of resistance to slow down the
            incoming rocket. This technique that may be used in entering Martian orbit is called aerobraking.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            The spacecraft is coming out of its voyage at more than 12,000 miles per hour. The spacecraft needs
            to slow down enough so that it can be pulled into orbit by Mars‚Äô gravity. One way to do this,
            as had been done in the Apollo missions to the moon, would be to use rocket propulsion.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            However, rocket propulsion is expensive, both financially and in terms of payload. ‚ÄúIf rocket
            propulsion had to be employed instead of aerobraking, the payloads delivered would be about 25
            percent less‚Äù (The Case for Mars). On this voyage, it is important to minimize unnecessary mass so
            that important scientific equipment and other necessities can go on the mission.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            Aerobraking, by reusing the heat shield needed for entry to land on Mars, saves financial and
            payload cost. This friction can slow down the spacecraft up to 90%, requiring only parachutes
            and/or small retro rockets on the lander.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            Overall, we‚Äôve seen that a mission to Mars will be incredibly complex, requiring near perfect precision
            in the actions of every crew member. It will be a difficult feat, but hopefully within the next
            couple generations, we will see humans on Mars.
