            Oh no! The ISS passed right under you! Orbital mechanics plagued early attempts at docking spacecraft,
            most notably in the failed rendezvous of Gemini IV. James McDivitt also thought to thrust forward in
            order to rendezvous with the Gemini booster, sending it away and underneath his spacecraft.

        <p class="dockText">
            Because you are in orbit around the Earth, when you fire your thrusters, you are increasing your velocity,
            sending you into a higher phasing orbit. A phasing orbit is a kind of Hohmann Transfer Orbit,
            adjusting the orbital altitude of a spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            In this higher orbit, the true anomaly of the spacecraft changes much more slowly due to the
            Conservation of Angular Momentum. This causes the linear distance between you and the target to increase,
            since its true anomaly is changing much faster than yours.
        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            In order to catch up with the ISS, you actually need to slow down! This puts you on a lower phasing orbit,
            speeding up the rate of change of your true anomaly relative to the target. Eventually, you and the target
            will have roughly the same true anomaly, so you can fire your thrusters to move back to the higher orbit
            and rendezvous with the ISS.
