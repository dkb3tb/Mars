            Sadly, you did not respond to the problem quick enough. This may seem unfair, but astronauts on a
            voyage to Mars will have to be prepared for extreme circumstances like this. It is impossible to be
            prepared for every possible emergency for such a trek, so needing Mission Control will be inevitable.

        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            That being said, it is crucial that astronauts minimize their reliance on Mission Control due to the
            extreme communication gap which we attempted to capture here. Depending on what points Earth and Mars
            are in orbit, the distance between them is between 78 million and 377 million kilometers. The speed of
            light (and radio signals) is only 386,000 km/s.

        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            This means that, once astronauts reach Mars, it could take up to 40 minutes to communicate between
            astronauts and Mission Control. Due to the constant change of distance between Earth and Mars, two-way
            communication will take anywhere from 8 minutes to 42 minutes.

        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            In emergencies, astronauts cannot rely on quick responses from Mission Control to aid them, so they
            must either wait, or figure out the problem for themselves. In addition, there are many psychological
            concerns that go along with this. Some researchers are working on programs to help astronauts solve
            personal and interpersonal problems on board so that they do not need to consult people on Earth.

        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            The program guides astronauts through different tasks such as brainstorming lists of problems and
            sorting them by irksomeness, allowing astronauts to prioritize solving them. Another example asks
            astronauts to reinterpret different scenarios to make them more understanding of othersâ€™ discomfort
            on the long voyage.

        </p>
        <p class="dockText">
            These programs will help make astronauts going to Mars more self-sufficient, but they still must be
            prepared to solve difficult technical problems on their own when Mission Control is 30 minutes away.
